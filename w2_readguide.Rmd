## Notes
__Note 1. These reading guidelines are incomplete and will be completed Friday 14-10-2022.__

Note 2. I *strongly* recommend to read Jackson et al. 2000 first. The Otto & Day Chapter is from a textbook where you learn to construct models. We will not be creating our own new models, as this course is more of a survey course. Don't let Otto & Day Chapter 2 stop your progress, get through it and we'll discuss in class!

Note 3. Ha, ugh, the image quality of Figure 1 isn't great! I will create a new version of that so it is more legible (looks like a computer from 1980!).

Note 4. The equations on page 697 should be:

\begin{align}
    C = aP
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    C =\frac{bP} {1 + cP}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    C = dPe^{-fP}
\end{align}
