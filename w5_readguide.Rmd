## Notes
Note 1. This will be the reading guide for Lehaye et al. 1994. It is currently incomplete, and will be completed Friday November 4.

## Overall reading advice

Tip 1. Consider a "three-pass" approach - read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paperâ€™s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.
