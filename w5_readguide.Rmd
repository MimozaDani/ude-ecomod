## Notes
Note 1. This will be the reading guide for Lehaye et al. 1994. It is currently incomplete, and will be completed Friday November 4.

Note 2. 2 things I asked you to do before class 11-11-2022: (i) Create a working simulation model for the Lotka-Volterra equations 3.14a and 3.15b. Determine values of r, N, and K where both species can co-exist (note I don't mind you Googling potential values for this). (ii) Create an account on github.com.

## Some questions to answer before class
