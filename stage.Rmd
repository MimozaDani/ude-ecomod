1. Resource 1: PDF chapter from book *A Primer of Ecology With R* (M. Henry H. Stevens, 2009), [__Stevens Ch2__](./media/Stevens_Ch2.pdf)

2. Resource 2: Really excellent course exercise online with guidance about Matrix population models in R, linked [here](https://kevintshoemaker.github.io/NRES-470/LAB4.html) - note this includes access to an external R package, *popbio*, that will calculate some properties such as population growth rate $\lambda$ for you.

3. Resource 3: A more basic (and therefore much easier to read) stage-structured models in R online resource, linked [here](http://ecovirtual.ib.usp.br/doku.php?id=en:ecovirt:roteiro:pop_str:pstr_mtr)

4. Resource 4: A document that explains stage-structured models well, but no interface with R (not a bad thing, as you can just learn more about the model type generally), linked [here](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Gettysburg_College/02%3A_Principles_of_Ecology_-_Gettysburg_College_ES_211/07%3A_A_Quantitative_Approach_to_Population_Ecology/7.03%3A_Leslie_Matrix_Models)
