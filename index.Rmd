Welcome to the **Ecological Modelling** course website

This website contains the content of the *Ecological Modelling* course taught by Prof. Dr. [Jelena H. Pantel](http://jhpantel.com) in the MS Aquatic Biology program at the University of Duisburg-Essen.

# QUICK NOTE R.E. CYBER ATTACK !!
I am aware that class is quite disrupted, between my illness + class cancellation last week and this week's CYBER ATTACK !!. Key information:

+ We **will** have class in-person on Thursday 01-12-2022.

+ To prepare for class, go through [__Reading Guide 5__](./w7_readguide.html)

+ We will focus 01-12-2022 class on getting caught up. Go through **Reading Guide 5**, get as far as you can, and we will work together to get caught up during class.

+ Our guest lecture on ecotoxicology models is rescheduled for 08-12-2022.

+ The course schedule is updated, and we will also have our first look at some more details for our 1st of 2 class assignments.

# Course Information

This is a seminar course, held from 16-18h on Thursdays, in room S05 R03 H8. I am available to meet Wednesdays 5-6pm over Zoom, but you must e-mail in advance of that time to let me know if you want to meet. The grade in the course will stem from 2 projects. Project 1 will be creating a "cheat sheet", or a 1-2 page document that provides an overview of a theoretical model in Ecology or Limnology. Project 2 will be a hands-on application, where you will take actual data and test predictions from theoretical models.

# Course Description

In this course, we will cover two broad topics: (1) we will get an overview of models that are used in Ecology, Evolution, and Aquatic Biology and (2) we will learn how to fit actual, observed data to theoretical models. We will gain proficiency in computational ecology, as we will use the statistical programming language R to work with models and data. The classroom is equipped with computer workstations.
