## Overview
We will make a "cheat sheet", or a 1-2 page colorful, informative info-graphic style PDF document that walks through a mathematical model of interest. The "cheat sheet" should contain information about:

+ A summary, verbal, of what the model consists of
+ A basic conceptual diagram that shows the *state variables*, with arrows showing relationships between state variables and *model parameters* that connect state variables.
+ A table with each variable or parameter in the model, a short verbal name for the variable or parameter, an indication of the range of values the parameter or variable can take, and the units of the parameter or variable.
+ The equation (choose 1, discrete-time or continuous-time)
+ A graphical inspection of the dynamics and general behavior of the model
+ A description of the *equilibrium behavior* of the model - under what conditions does the state variable reach *equilibrium* and no longer change?

You will submit the cheat sheet, and use R code to create some of the graphs (and you will submit this R code along with the cheat sheet itself). For writing formulas, you can use Microsoft Word / Powerpoint, but you can also use R Markdown.

## When will we have time to discuss and work on this?

+ We will first look over the assignment in class Thursday 01-12-2022. For class Thursday 08-12-2022, I will have a list of instructions to complete by class that day, and I will have a general template you can follow for what a cheat sheet might look like. For class Thursday 15-12-2022, I will have completed a template you can follow, and will include some more instructions for what you should have finished that day.

+ The entire class period 22-12-2022 will be remote / online, and will be devoted to working on your course project. We will sign into a Zoom session, and we will work on our cheat sheet during the remote course session.

+ The assignment will be due by the final day of class, 02-02-2023.

## Is there a template I can look at so I can get started on the assignment?

+ I will create a Draft Template by Thursday 08-12-2022. I will create a Final Template by 15-12-2022. I will update with a more detailed list of instructions by 08-12-2022. For now, here is a *very* insufficient example. ![Very insufficient first look at a Draft CModel Cheat Sheet](./media/screen-5.jpg){width="100%"}

+ It will be in the style of R Cheat Sheets, such as the one seen [__here__](./media/bayesplot.pdf).

## What if I want to get started now?

+ I would advise to begin by creating a simulation in R of your model of choice. Contact me if you would like to choose a model and begin.

+ Candidate models so far are: ![Candidate models we have discussed so far](./media/screen-6.jpg){width="100%"}
